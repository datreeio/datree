## ü§î What is Datree?

[Datree](https://datree.io/) automatically validates Kubernetes objects for rule violations, ensuring no misconfigurations reach production. It‚Äôs an E2E policy enforcement solution that can be used as a cluster guardrail, on the command line, or even as a kubectl plugin to run policies against Kubernetes objects.

It‚Äôs far more effective than manual processes, such as sending an email to a slew of developers, begging them to set various limits, which likely falls on deaf ears because developers are already overwhelmed.

## ‚úåÔ∏è Quick-start in two steps

### 1. Add the Datree Helm repository
Run the following command in your terminal:
```terminal
helm repo add datree-webhook https://datreeio.github.io/admission-webhook-datree
helm repo update
```

### 2. Install Datree on your cluster
Replace `<TOKEN>` with the token from your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/), and run the following command in your terminal:  
```terminal
helm install -n datree datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook \
--create-namespace \
--set datree.token=<TOKEN>
```

This will create a new namespace (datree), where Datree‚Äôs services and application resources will reside. `datree.token` is used to connect your dashboard to your cluster. Note that the installation can take up to 5 minutes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

Datree scans Kubernetes configurations and validates them against a centrally managed policy for rule violations and misconfigurations.

![Architecture](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/blob/main/images/datree_architecture_light.png#gh-light-mode-only)  
![Architecture](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/blob/main/images/datree_architecture_dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) 

Datree acts as a guardrail, enforcing your desired policies on the cluster. You can also shift-left your validations by using our [CLI tool](https://hub.datree.io/cli) during development and/or as part of your CI.

Datree comes with dozens of battle-tested rules for you to select to create your policy. The policy rules cover a variety of Kubernetes resources such as workload security, networking availability, Argo best practices, NSA hardening guide, and [many more](https://hub.datree.io/built-in-rules). 

In addition to our built-in rules, you can write [any custom rule you wish](https://hub.datree.io/custom-rules-overview) and then run it against your Kubernetes configurations to check for rule violations. The custom rule engine is based on JSON Schema.

## üîå Helm plugin

[Datree's Helm plugin](https://github.com/datreeio/helm-datree) can be accessed through the helm CLI to provide a seamless experience to Helm users:

`helm plugin install https://github.com/datreeio/helm-datree`

## üóÇ Kustomize support

Datree comes with out-of-the-box [support for Kustomize](https://hub.datree.io/kustomize-support):

`datree kustomize test [kustomization.yaml dir path/]`

## Management dashboard (web application)

Datree can be customized via code (policy as code) or via a management dashboard. The dashboard offers the following capabilities in an intuitive visual interface: 
* Customize policies
* Edit rules failure message
* Issue tokens
* View policy check history
* Configure Kubernetes schema version

## ‚úîÔ∏è Next step: Shift-left your validations

In addition to protecting your cluster, you can use Datree in every step of your Kuberenetes pipeline to help you prevent misconfigurations:  
* [Develop (code)](https://hub.datree.io/#2-test-a-kubernetes-demo-manifest) - run the CLI locally (or as a pre-commit hook) to get instant validation  
* [Distribute (CI)](https://hub.datree.io/cicd-examples) - integrate with your CI platform to shift-left policy checks  
* [Deploy (CD)](https://github.com/datreeio/admission-webhook-datree) - gate your cluster with the admission webhook  
* [Runtime (production)](https://github.com/datreeio/kubectl-datree) - query deployed resources with the kubectl plugin to your know your status
