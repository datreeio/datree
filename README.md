## What is Datree?
[Datree](https://datree.io/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss) is a CLI tool that supports Kubernetes admins in their roles by preventing developers from making errors in Kubernetes configurations that can cause clusters to fail in production. Our CLI tool is open source, enabling it to be supported by the Kubernetes community.  

Itâ€™s far more effective than manual processes, such as sending an email to a slew of developers, begging them to set various limits, which likely falls on deaf ears because developers are already overwhelmed. 

## How it Works
The CLI integration provides a policy enforcement solution for Kubernetes to run automatic checks on every code change for rule violations and misconfigurations. When rule violations are found, Datree produces an alert that guides the developer to fix the issue inside the CI process â€” or even earlier as a pre-commit hook â€” while explaining the reason behind the rule.

## Quick start in two steps
#### 1. Install the latest release on your CLI  
_Linux & MacOS:_ `curl https://get.datree.io | /bin/bash`  
_Windows:_ `iwr -useb https://get.datree.io/windows_install.ps1 | iex`  

_Other installation options (Homebrew, Docker, etc.) can be found [here](https://hub.datree.io/#a-1-install-datrees-cli-integration/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss)_

#### 2. Pass datree a Kubernetes manifest file to scan
`datree test [k8s-manifest-file]`  

...and voilÃ , you just ran your first invocation! ðŸ¥³

## Playground
[![katacoda-logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datreeio/datree/main/images/katacoda-logo.png)](https://www.katacoda.com/datree/scenarios/datree-demo)  
You can also checkout our [interactive demo scenario](https://www.katacoda.com/datree/scenarios/datree-demo) on Katacoda without having to install anything on your machine.  

## Ready to review our "Getting Started" guide?
All the information needed to get started, as well as a bunch of other cool features (including how to set up your policy), can be found in [**our docs**](https://hub.datree.io/getting-started/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss).

## Helm plugin
[Datree's Helm plugin](https://hub.datree.io/helm-plugin/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss) can be accessed through the helm CLI, to provide a seamless experience to Helm users:  

`helm plugin install https://github.com/datreeio/helm-datree`  

## Built-in schema & policy validation
Every check will validate [your schema](https://hub.datree.io/schema-validation/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss). In addition, there are 30 battle-tested rules for you to select to create your policy.

The policy rules cover a variety of Kubernetes resources and use cases:
* [Workload](https://hub.datree.io/workload/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss)
* [CronJob](https://hub.datree.io/cronjob/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss)
* [Containers](https://hub.datree.io/containers/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss)
* [Networking](https://hub.datree.io/networking/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss)
* [Deprecation](https://hub.datree.io/deprecation/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss)
* [Others](https://hub.datree.io/other/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss)

## Custom rules
In additon to our built-in rules, you can write [any custom rule](https://hub.datree.io/custom-rules-overview/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss) you wish, and then run them against your Kubernetes configurations to check for rule violations. The custom rule engine is based on JSON Schema.

## Support

[Datree](https://datree.io/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss) builds and maintains this project to make Kubernetes policies simple and accessible. Start with our [documentation](https://hub.datree.io/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss) for quick tutorials and examples.

## Disclaimer

We do our best to maintain backward compatibility, but there may be breaking changes in
the future to the command usage, flags, and configuration file formats. The CLI will output a warning message when a new version with breaking changes is detected.
We encourage you to use Datree to test your Kubernetes manifests files and Helm charts, see what
breaks, and [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
