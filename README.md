# Datree

[Datree](https://www.datree.io/) (pronounced `/da-tree/`) secures your Kubernetes by blocking the deployment of misconfigured resources.

## ‚úåÔ∏è Quick-start in two steps

Install Datree to get insights on the status of your cluster and enforce your desired policies on new resources.

> **NOTE:**  
> By default, Datree does not block misconfigured resources, it only monitors and alerts about them.  
> To enable **enforcement mode**, see the [documentation](https://hub.datree.io/setup/behavior#options).

### 1. Add the Datree Helm repository
Run the following command in your terminal:
```terminal
helm repo add datree-webhook https://datreeio.github.io/admission-webhook-datree
helm repo update
```

### 2. Install Datree on your cluster
Replace `<DATREE_TOKEN>` with the token from your [dashboard](https://app.datree.io/), and run the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
helm install -n datree datree-webhook datree-webhook/datree-admission-webhook --debug \
--create-namespace \
--set datree.token=<DATREE_TOKEN> \
--set datree.clusterName=$(kubectl config current-context)
```

This will create a new namespace (datree), where Datree‚Äôs services and application resources will reside. `datree.token` is used to connect your dashboard to your cluster. Note that the installation can take up to 5 minutes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

Datree scans Kubernetes resources against a centrally managed policy, and blocks those that violate your desired policies.

Datree comes with over 100 rules covering various use-cases, such as workload security, high availability, ArgoCD best practices, NSA hardening guide, and [many more](https://hub.datree.io/built-in-rules). 

In addition to our built-in rules, you can write [any custom rule you wish](https://hub.datree.io/custom-rules-overview) and then run it against your Kubernetes configurations to check for rule violations. Custom rules can be written in [JSON schema](https://hub.datree.io/custom-rules/custom-rules-overview) or in [Rego](https://hub.datree.io/custom-rules/rego-support).

## üìä Management dashboard (web application)

Datree's dashboard provides valuable information about your clusters' health and stability. It details the resources that failed your policy checks, and shows you how to fix each violation.

Datree can be configured via code or via the dashboard. The dashboard offers the following capabilities in an intuitive visual interface: 
* Control Datree's configuration:
  * Default action on failure - set whether resources that failed the policy check should be blocked or only monitored
  * Set which policy to use for your checks
  * Define resources and/or namespaces to ignore
* Create & customize policies
* Edit rules' failure message
* Issue tokens
* View policy check history
* Configure Kubernetes schema version

## ü§© Additional features

Datree offers a suite of features to make adoption seamless:
* **Monitoring** - Datree is first installed in monitoring mode that reports on policy violations, rather than block their deployments.
* [**CLI**](https://hub.datree.io/cli/getting-started) - Help your developers find misconfigurations in their configs before deploying them, by integrating Datree into their CI.
* **Simple integrations** - Datree works seamlessly with popular CD tools such as ArgoCD and FluxCD, and comes with ready-made integrations for various CI platforms.
* **Cluster score** - Rank the stability of your cluster based on the number of detected misconfigurations.
