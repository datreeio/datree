## What is Datree?
[Datree](https://datree.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic_oss) helps to prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations from ever making it to production.  

The CLI integration provides policies enforcement solution for Kubernetes to run automatic checks on every pull request for rule violations and misconfigurations. When rule violations are found, Datree prevents merging and shows the developer instructions to understand and fix the issue inside the CI process.  

## Quick start in two steps
#### 1. Install the latest release on your CLI  
**MacOS:** ``curl https://get.datree.io | /bin/sh``  
**Linux:** ``curl https://get.datree.io/install-linux.sh | /bin/sh``  
**Windows:** ``not supported yet :(``  

#### 2. Pass datree a Kuberntes manifest file
``datree test <k8s-manifest-file>``  

...and voilÃ , you just made your first invocation! ðŸ¥³    
In your CLI, you will see something like that:
